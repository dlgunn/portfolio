		<h1>Welcome to Dallon Gunn's portfolio!</h1>
		<hr>
		<h2>The best portfolio you have ever seen.</h2>
		<p>I'm just so qualified and I've done so many things. How could you ever get another candidate as qualified as me? It's impossible obviously.</p>
		<p>I go to BYU, I like to make random websites, I have 37 goldfish, I don't believe in gravity (at least not like you think), and I have an above average amount of arms.</p>
		<h3>Here's a list of all my accomplishments and projects:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>I built this website in my CS260 class</li>
			<li>I completed the extra credit lab in CS142 (That's impressive)</li>
			<li>I got into BYU (barely)</li>
			<li>I did a science fair project about machine learning once (no, I really didn't know how any of it worked)</li>
			<li>I wrote a chrome extension to taked every instance of the word "Covid" or "Coronavirus" on a website and replace it with a typo.</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>Here's my work experience:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>I worked drywall for 3 years with Dennis Colvin</li>
			<li>I currently work as a physics TA for a class I never took (yikes)</li>
			<li>That's pretty much it I guess</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>Additionally I'm just so cool and here are my best attributes:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Humble</li>
			<li>Qualified</li>
			<li>Creative</li>
		</ul>
